# CytrynChatBot
This is the CytrynChatBot! It utilizes the Telegram Bot API along with several other libraries to create a chatbot powered by my homemade AI!
This chatbot includes several commands and is meant to sell a product, as well as serve as a chatbot.
CytrynChatBot was created in order to serve as an example for Loora AI for use of their AI on a telegram bot.

Current features:
Text the chatbot: you can text it and my AI will respond in the best manner possible.
Talk to the chatbot: You can send a voice message to my chatbot and it will respond with a text AND send a voice message back!
Saves everything: Saves the chat logs into folders organized by user (Users/{user_id}). Saves voice notes received by user, sent by chatbot, and everything said to a txt file.

API's used: Telegram Bot API (through python-telegram-bot library), Google Cloud text-to-speech API and speech-to-text API.
Please check requirements.txt for libraries required.

Enjoy!
